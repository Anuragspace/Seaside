# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix environment variable loading in main.go
  - Modify godotenv.Load() call to handle missing .env file gracefully
  - Change error handling from fatal error to warning log
  - Add logging to show which environment variables are being used
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Enhance migration path resolution
  - [x] 2.1 Update migration runner to try multiple path strategies
    - Modify getMigrationFiles() to try multiple directory paths
    - Add path resolution logic that works in different deployment contexts
    - Log all attempted paths for debugging purposes
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.3_

  - [x] 2.2 Improve error messages in migration system
    - Update error messages to include attempted paths
    - Add specific error handling for common deployment scenarios
    - Provide actionable error messages for troubleshooting
    - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Add comprehensive startup logging
  - [x] 3.1 Implement environment variable status logging
    - Log which critical environment variables are set/missing
    - Add startup sequence logging for better debugging
    - Include database connection status in logs
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

  - [x] 3.2 Enhance database initialization error handling
    - Improve error messages for database connection failures
    - Add validation for required environment variables before connection attempts
    - Log migration execution status and results
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Create deployment-specific configuration handling
  - Add detection for production vs development environment
  - Implement environment-specific path resolution strategies
  - Add fallback mechanisms for missing configuration files
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 5. Write tests for deployment fixes
  - [x] 5.1 Create unit tests for environment loading
    - Test graceful handling of missing .env file
    - Test environment variable precedence (system vs file)
    - Test error logging behavior
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

  - [x] 5.2 Create tests for migration path resolution
    - Test multiple path resolution strategies
    - Test error handling for missing migration directories
    - Test logging of attempted paths
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
