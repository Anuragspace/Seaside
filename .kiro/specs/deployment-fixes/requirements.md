# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical deployment issues preventing the Seaside application from running successfully on Render. The application currently fails during startup due to missing .env file handling and incorrect migration file paths in production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to start successfully on Render without requiring a .env file, so that the deployment process works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts in production THEN the system SHALL NOT fail if no .env file is present
2. WHEN environment variables are set via Render's interface THEN the system SHALL use those variables directly
3. WHEN the .env file is missing THEN the system SHALL log a warning but continue startup

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database migrations to run correctly during deployment, so that the database schema is properly initialized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL locate migration files regardless of working directory
2. WHEN migrations are run THEN the system SHALL handle both local development and production deployment paths
3. WHEN migration files cannot be found THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with attempted paths

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling during application startup, so that deployment failures are easier to diagnose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN startup errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL specify which variables are required
3. WHEN file paths are incorrect THEN the system SHALL log all attempted paths for debugging
