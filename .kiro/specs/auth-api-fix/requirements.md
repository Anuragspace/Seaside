# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The authentication system is currently experiencing 404 errors during user signup, preventing new users from registering for the video conferencing platform. This issue needs to be resolved to ensure proper user onboarding and authentication flow. The fix should address API endpoint routing, error handling, and ensure seamless integration between the frontend authentication service and backend handlers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to be able to sign up for an account successfully, so that I can access the video conferencing platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid signup credentials THEN the system SHALL create a new user account without returning 404 errors
2. WHEN the signup API endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate HTTP status codes (200/201 for success, 400 for validation errors)
3. WHEN signup is successful THEN the system SHALL return valid authentication tokens (access and refresh tokens)
4. WHEN signup fails due to validation errors THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages indicating what needs to be corrected

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication API endpoints to be properly configured and accessible, so that the frontend can communicate with the backend without routing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes requests to `/api/auth/register` THEN the system SHALL route the request to the correct handler
2. WHEN the backend server starts THEN the system SHALL properly register all authentication routes
3. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL allow requests from the frontend domain
4. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL include proper middleware for request validation and error handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback when authentication operations fail, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authentication error occurs THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with meaningful messages
2. WHEN a 404 error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the attempted endpoint and provide debugging information
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return specific field-level error messages
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the frontend SHALL display user-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of authentication endpoints, so that I can quickly identify and resolve API issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication requests are made THEN the system SHALL log request details including endpoint, method, and response status
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log stack traces and context information for debugging
3. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL verify that all required environment variables and configurations are present
4. WHEN API health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL report the status of authentication services

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to handle edge cases gracefully, so that the application remains stable under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate email registration is attempted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages without crashing
2. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all inputs before processing
3. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL return service unavailable errors with retry suggestions
4. WHEN OAuth2 providers are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to email/password authentication
